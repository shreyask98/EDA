# Student Performance Analysis EDA

This is a project for analyzing the performance of students in a school. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to academic success and identify areas where improvements can be made.
Data

The data for this project comes from a fictitious school and contains information on students' demographic characteristics, family background, and academic performance. The dataset includes 1000 records and 8 columns, including gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, and writing score.
Methodology

The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

The project answers the following questions:

    How do different demographic factors impact student performance?
    What is the relationship between test preparation and academic performance?
    How are the three subject scores (math, reading, and writing) related to each other?

Files

    student_performance_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis
    student_performance.csv: dataset used in the analysis
    README.md: this file

Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the Jupyter notebook:

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib

Conclusion

The analysis found that parental level of education and test preparation course were significant predictors of academic performance. Students who had parents with higher levels of education and those who completed a test preparation course tended to perform better in all three subjects. There was also a strong correlation between math and reading scores, and a moderate correlation between math and writing scores. These findings suggest that targeted interventions to improve test preparation and parental involvement could improve student performance.

# World Population Analysis EDA Project

This project aims to analyze the world population from the year 1950 to the present day. The data used in this project is sourced from the United Nations' World Population Prospects.
Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

    world_population_data.csv: This file contains the raw data of the world population from 1950 to the present day.
    world_population_analysis.ipynb: This is the Jupyter notebook file where the data analysis is performed.
    README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.

Project Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

    Python 3.5 or higher
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

Data Cleaning

The raw data obtained from the United Nations' World Population Prospects was cleaned before analyzing. The following cleaning steps were performed:

    Removed any columns containing missing values.
    Dropped any duplicate rows.
    Converted the year column to a datetime data type.
    Converted the population column to an integer data type.

Data Analysis

The cleaned data was analyzed using Python's Pandas library. The following analyses were performed:

    Total world population from 1950 to the present day.
    World population by year.
    World population growth rate by year.

Conclusion

The analysis of world population from 1950 to the present day shows that the world population has been steadily increasing over the years. The growth rate has fluctuated but has remained positive throughout the years. The analysis provides insights into the world population growth patterns, which can be useful for future planning and policy-making.
