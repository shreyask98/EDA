# World Population Analysis EDA Project

This project aims to analyze the world population from the year 1950 to the present day. The data used in this project is sourced from the United Nations' World Population Prospects.
Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

    world_population_data.csv: This file contains the raw data of the world population from 1950 to the present day.
    world_population_analysis.ipynb: This is the Jupyter notebook file where the data analysis is performed.
    README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.

Project Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

    Python 3.5 or higher
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

Data Cleaning

The raw data obtained from the United Nations' World Population Prospects was cleaned before analyzing. The following cleaning steps were performed:

    Removed any columns containing missing values.
    Dropped any duplicate rows.
    Converted the year column to a datetime data type.
    Converted the population column to an integer data type.

Data Analysis

The cleaned data was analyzed using Python's Pandas library. The following analyses were performed:

    Total world population from 1950 to the present day.
    World population by year.
    World population growth rate by year.

Conclusion

The analysis of world population from 1950 to the present day shows that the world population has been steadily increasing over the years. The growth rate has fluctuated but has remained positive throughout the years. The analysis provides insights into the world population growth patterns, which can be useful for future planning and policy-making.
